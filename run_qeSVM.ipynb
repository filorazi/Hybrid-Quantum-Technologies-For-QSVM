    "To overcome the problem of the limited connectivity of the Chimera graph of the DW2000Q QA the whole training set is split into small disjoint subsets $D^{(train,l)}$ of $~40$ samples, with $l=0,...,int(N/40)$. \n",
    "The strategy is to build an ensemble of quantum weak SVMs (qeSVMs) where each classifier is trained on $D^{(train,l)}$. \n",
    "This is achieved in two steps. First, for each subset $D^{(train,l)}$ the twenty best solutions from the DW2000Q QA (i.e., qSVM$(B, K, \\xi , \\gamma )\\#i$ for $i =0, ... ,19$) are combined by averaging over the respective decision functions $f^{l,i}(\\mathbf{x})$ (see Eq. (3)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the decision function is linear in the coefficients\n",
    "and the bias $b^{(l,i)}$ is computed from $\\alpha_{n}^{(l,i)}$ via Eq. (4), this procedure effectively results in one classifier with an effective set of coefficients \n",
    "$\\alpha_{n}^{(l)}=\\sum_{i} \\alpha_{n}^{(l, i)} / 20$ and bias \n",
    "$b^{l}=\\sum_{i} b^{(l, i)} / 20$.\n",
    "Second, an average is made over the $int(N/40)$ subsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that the data points \n",
    "$\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{n}^{(l)}, y_{n}^{(l)}\\right) \\in D^{(\\text {train }, l)}$ are now different for each $l$. The full decision function is\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
